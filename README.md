Welcome to **Pixel Word of the Day** â€” a cute, pink, pixel-style web app that helps you learn Polish one word at a time!

Whether you're just starting out with Polish or brushing up, this app makes language learning a little more fun and a lot more aesthetic.

## ðŸ§° Built With

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**
- **Electron Framework** â€“ for desktop compatibility

## ðŸ’– Why I Made This

I'm passionate about languages and love cute visual styles. I wanted to make something simple, useful, and fun â€” so this project became a way to mix learning with a pixel art vibe that I enjoy creating.
